# GSCLinux 
Void linux based distribution with some additional features

## Story
I just want to learn linux and how it works, the best way to learn something is to build from scratch (just my humble opinion). I migrate to linux from windows since
early 2020 when i my parents bought me thinkpad t440p and i decide to back to linux (3-4 times) attempt in the past, hopping from POP!_OS -> Manjaro -> Arch Linux
-> Void Linux -> Gentoo and back agin to Void (because i just too lazy to wait for compiling my programs). I try Linux From Scratch (LFS) too,it really fun too build 
linux from scratch, maybe on the future GSCLinux can move from void to be independent. and while i learning about linux, i also got interested with Rust Programming
Language so i decide to make my personal void linux spinoff with my preference setup and tools that i build with Rust.

## Warning
This Project just for my learning resources, but if you still want to try, i can't stop you !!!
